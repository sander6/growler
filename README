= Growler: Growl support for your Ruby applications

Growler is a Ruby utility for posting notifications and registering applications through the Growl Framework. Unlike other Growl libraries, Growler uses Ruby idioms and intelligent data massaging to make it easy and natural to post notifications without having to know too much about how finicky Growl actually is.

== Requirements

Growler is compatible with Growl versions >= 1.1.2; versions as old a 0.6 might work, but haven't been tested.

Growler can obviously only post notifications on Mac OS X platforms (>=10.4). Network functionality is planned to allow notifications to be sent FROM non-Mac platforms, but the end host must obviously be running Mac OS X and have the Growl Framework installed.

Growler requires RubyCocoa for application registration. There seems to be no gem for it, but if you have MacPorts, RubyCocoa can be installed with simply

  $ sudo port install rb-cocoa

Binaries or source code are available from the RubyCocoa SourceForge page (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=44114).

RubyCocoa has its own set of requirements to build and use. Read about them at the RubyCocoa project page http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/GettingStarted.

== License

Growler is released under the Ruby License. See the included LICENSE file for details.

== Installation

Growler can be installed via RubyGems.

  $ sudo gem install growler
  
Or cloned from the git repository and installed from local source.

  $ git clone git://github.com/PLACEHOLDER/growler.git
  $ cd growler
  $ gem install ./growler-[version].gem

= Summary

To use Growler, require the gem

  require 'growler'

Growler can be used in one of two ways:
1. to send simple notifications, or
2. to register a full application with the Growl framework and send messages through that.

=== Simple notifications

Sending "simple" notifications is mediated through methods on the Growl module itself. The Growl module wraps the growlnotify command line utility. To use, set your message arguments as instance variable on the Growl module, then call Growl.post.

  Growl[:title] = "Process Completed"
  Growl[:message] = "My work here is done."
  Growl.post

See the Growl module for a full list of options and usage instructions.

=== Registering applications

Growl::Application objects define applications registered with Growl, specifically the name, the default icon, and a list of notifications available to that application.

To create and register an application, instantiate a new application object, pass the attributes you want to set to it, create some notifications for it, and then call register!.

  app = Growl::Application.new
  app[:name] = "My Awesome Ruby Application"
  n1 = Growl::Notification.new(...)
  n2 = Growl::Notification.new(...)
  app.add_notifications(n1, n2)
  app.register!
  
This will register the application with Growl. Building and registering an application with Growl allows you much more control and flexibility in the display of your notifications; after registration you can then open the Growl preference pane and set display options for each of that application's notifications, such as the display style, screen position, and priority. Unfortunately, there is no way to script these settings; it's up to your end-users to set fancy display styles for themselves.

To post notifications, call notify_by_name on the Application instance and pass it a name that you defined when registering of the notification you want.

  app.notify_by_name("Process Completed")
  
See Growl::Application for full details on building and registering applications and see Growl::Notification for details on building notifications.
