TODO:

1. Write real tests
  - how can you check if the notification posted without looking at it?
  - can you get notification information from the GrowlApplicationBridge?
  
2. Get this on RubyForge
  - figure out what the problem with pushing to RubyForge is.
  - downplay all the stuff where you say you can install this with 'gem'.
  
3. Review all the code
  - fix the stupid bugs (like that stupid Growl attr_accessor bug).
  - Change the documentation wherever it refers to old features.
