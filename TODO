TODO:

1. Write real tests
  - how can you check if the notification posted without looking at it?
  - can you get notification information from the GrowlApplicationBridge?
  
2. Get this on RubyForge
  - figure out what the problem with pushing to RubyForge is.
  - downplay all the stuff where you say you can install this with 'gem'.
  
3. Review all the code
  - fix the stupid bugs (like that stupid Growl attr_accessor bug).
  - Change the documentation wherever it refers to old features.
  
4. Complete features
  - figure out what :udp, :auth, :crypt, :port, :progress and :wait options do
    for growlnotify.

5. Accommodate people on Macs that don't have Growl installed
  - check for this when checking for the platform.
  - if Growl isn't installed, fail spectacularly!

6. Fix the RDocs
  - both the OSXy and non-OSXy Application and Notification classes are merged on the same page.
  - fix this transparently so that Growler works the same on all platforms.
